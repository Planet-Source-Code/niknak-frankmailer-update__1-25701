### Description

Frankmailer is a beta mail suite application, it sends and recieves email from SMTP/POP3 servers. I have modified the checkmail routine so it's now even faster. If you haven't downloaded this or even if you have, I reccommend downloading this new version, it's coming along in leaps and bounds and in the next release I hope to have the ability to send attachments with the emails also. Just for reference all downloaded emails are saved in Outlook Express format and attachments can be downloaded perfectly, I have tested it many times and it hasn't fallen over once! Please vote for it, and comment on it!
